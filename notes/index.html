      <h2>Chapter 1 - Essentials</h2>
      <blockquote cite="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/the-iphone-photography/9781681986937/Text/chapter26.xhtml">Some of the work people are creating out there on their iPhone cameras is absolutely stunning. You have the camera that can do that.
        The only thing standing between you and those images isn't technology, it's you. Your intent makes the difference.</blockquote>
      <ul>
        <li>Tap on the an object to <em>focus</em> on it. Tap and hold on the screen to lock focus and exposure.</li>
        <li>Hold your camera still by tucking your arms in, or leaning on something.</li>
        <li>Turn the built-in flash off permanently.</li>
        <li>Don't pinch to zoom (aka "digital zoom"). Use one of your phone's built in lenses by clicking on the x1, x0.5 or x2 buttons</li>
        <li>If yor picture is too dark it's "underexposed". If it's too bright it's "overexposed". You can control exposure in the camera app after focusing by dragging up or down.</li>
        <li>There's a RAW format that, in general, we  won't use.</li>
        <li>You can get as close to 3 inches without your subject being out of focus. (close up images are sometimes called Macro Shots)</li>
        <li>If you feel that your white-balance is off, put a white piece of paper in front of the camera and focus on it. (Or use a 3rd party app like Lightroom)</li>
        <li>If your subject is moving, use <em>Burst mode</em> by swiping left on the shutter button and choosing the best image.</li>
        <li>Tip for ultra-wide shots: take them from really low or really high.</li>
        <li>You can get to your camera from the lock screen by swiping left.</li>
        <li>The more light, the better the photo!</li>
      </ul>
